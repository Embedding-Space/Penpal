# Technical Specification

This is the technical specification for the spec detailed in @.agent-os/specs/2025-09-13-logfire-integration/spec.md

> Created: 2025-09-13
> Version: 1.0.0

## Technical Requirements

- **Main Process Integration**: Install and configure `logfire` npm package in main Electron process for Node.js environment
- **Renderer Process Integration**: Install and configure `@pydantic/logfire-browser` package in renderer processes (browser environment)
- **Secure Token Storage**: Use Electron's `safeStorage.encryptString()` to encrypt Logfire write token before storing in electron-store as base64 string
- **Environment Variable Management**: Programmatically set `LOGFIRE_TOKEN` environment variable at runtime from decrypted stored token
- **Lifecycle Event Logging**: Implement startup logging in main process and optional shutdown logging with graceful cleanup
- **CLI Token Management**: Create npm scripts `logfire:set-token` and `logfire:clear-token` for development workflow
- **Zero-Overhead Design**: Rely on Logfire's built-in behavior to gracefully handle missing tokens without performance impact
- **Security Considerations**: Ensure no token leakage in logs, error messages, or console output

## Approach

### Implementation Strategy

1. **Dual Package Architecture**: Implement separate Logfire integrations for main and renderer processes using appropriate SDKs
2. **Security-First Token Management**: Implement encrypted token storage using Electron's built-in security features
3. **Development-Friendly Workflow**: Provide CLI tools for easy token management during development
4. **Graceful Degradation**: Ensure application functions normally when Logfire is not configured

### Security Architecture

- Tokens encrypted at rest using Electron's `safeStorage` API
- Runtime environment variable injection to avoid hardcoded secrets
- No token exposure in application logs or debugging output
- Secure token clearing functionality for development environments

## External Dependencies

- **logfire** - Official Pydantic Logfire SDK for Node.js/main process integration
  - **Justification:** Required for main Electron process observability and telemetry

- **@pydantic/logfire-browser** - Official Pydantic Logfire browser SDK for renderer processes
  - **Justification:** Required for renderer process observability in browser environment (cannot use Node.js packages in renderer)

- **electron-store** - Already in project for settings storage, will be used for encrypted token storage
  - **Justification:** Existing dependency for application settings, extended to store encrypted secrets
