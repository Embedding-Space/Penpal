# Spec Requirements Document

> Spec: Logfire Integration
> Created: 2025-09-13

## Overview

Integrate Pydantic Logfire observability platform into Penpal's main Electron process to provide basic application lifecycle monitoring. This feature will enable developers to track application startup and shutdown events with secure token management via environment variables.

## User Stories

### Developer Observability

As a developer working on Penpal, I want to see application lifecycle events in Logfire, so that I can monitor app health and debug issues effectively.

The developer can configure a Logfire write token in a `.env` file, launch the application, and immediately see startup events with useful metadata (platform, architecture) in their Logfire dashboard. When the application shuts down gracefully, a shutdown event is also logged.

### Simple Token Management

As a developer, I want straightforward token configuration via environment variables, so that I can easily enable/disable observability without complex setup.

The developer can add `LOGFIRE_TOKEN=their-token` to a `.env` file for immediate integration, with the approach designed to seamlessly support future Settings UI integration.

## Spec Scope

1. **Environment-Based Token Management** - Use dotenv to load Logfire write token from `.env` file
2. **Main Process Integration** - Configure Logfire logging in the main Electron process with service metadata
3. **Lifecycle Event Logging** - Log application startup and shutdown with useful diagnostic attributes
4. **Security Protection** - Ensure no token leakage in logs, errors, or console output
5. **Zero Configuration Overhead** - Application runs cleanly when no token is present

## Out of Scope

- Renderer process integration (separate spec/issue)
- GUI-based token management interface (future phase)
- Custom Logfire dashboard creation
- Integration with other observability platforms
- Advanced instrumentation beyond basic lifecycle events
- Client traces proxy architecture

## Expected Deliverable

1. Application launches successfully and logs "Penpal app started" message to Logfire dashboard with platform/arch metadata
2. Application shutdown gracefully logs "Penpal app shutdown" message to Logfire
3. Logfire write token configured via `LOGFIRE_TOKEN` in `.env` file
4. No errors or token exposure when token is not configured
5. Service properly identified as `penpal-main` with app version in Logfire
