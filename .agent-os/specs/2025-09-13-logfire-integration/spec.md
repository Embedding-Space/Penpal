# Spec Requirements Document

> Spec: Logfire Integration
> Created: 2025-09-13

## Overview

Integrate Pydantic Logfire observability platform into the Penpal application to provide comprehensive monitoring and telemetry for both main Electron process and renderer processes. This feature will enable developers to track application startup, shutdown, and runtime events across the entire application lifecycle.

## User Stories

### Developer Observability

As a developer working on Penpal, I want to see application lifecycle events in Logfire, so that I can monitor app health and debug issues effectively.

The developer can configure a Logfire write token, launch the application, and immediately see startup events in their Logfire dashboard. When the application shuts down gracefully, a shutdown event is also logged, providing complete lifecycle visibility.

### Seamless Development Workflow

As a developer, I want simple CLI commands to manage Logfire credentials, so that I can quickly set up and tear down observability without manual configuration file editing.

The developer can use npm run scripts to set or clear the Logfire write token, enabling quick iteration between different Logfire projects or temporarily disabling logging.

## Spec Scope

1. **Secure Token Storage** - Implement encrypted storage of Logfire write tokens using Electron's safeStorage API
2. **Main Process Integration** - Configure Logfire logging in the main Electron process with startup/shutdown events
3. **Renderer Process Integration** - Set up Logfire browser integration for renderer processes
4. **CLI Token Management** - Create npm scripts for setting and clearing Logfire write tokens
5. **Environment Variable Handling** - Programmatically set LOGFIRE_TOKEN environment variable at runtime

## Out of Scope

- GUI-based token management interface
- Custom Logfire dashboard creation
- Integration with other observability platforms
- Advanced log filtering or custom instrumentation beyond basic lifecycle events
- Performance metrics collection beyond what Logfire provides by default

## Expected Deliverable

1. Application launches successfully and logs "Penpal app started" message to Logfire dashboard
2. Application shutdown gracefully logs "Penpal app shutdown" message to Logfire (stretch goal)
3. Logfire write token can be set via `npm run logfire:set-token` command
4. Logfire write token can be cleared via `npm run logfire:clear-token` command
