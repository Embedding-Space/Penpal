# Spec Summary (Lite)

Integrate Pydantic Logfire observability into Penpal's main process only using dotenv token management from `.env` files. The implementation enables basic application lifecycle monitoring with startup/shutdown events and platform metadata logged to Logfire dashboard. Success is measured by seeing "Penpal app started" messages with service name `penpal-main` in Logfire when launching the application with a configured token.
