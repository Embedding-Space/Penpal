# Spec Summary (Lite)

Integrate Pydantic Logfire observability platform into Penpal's main and renderer processes with secure token storage via Electron's safeStorage API. The implementation enables application lifecycle monitoring with startup/shutdown events logged to Logfire dashboard, plus CLI tools for token management. Success is measured by seeing "Penpal app started" messages in Logfire when launching the application.
