# Product Mission (Lite)

Penpal is an AI agent management application that helps developers and tinkerers create and interact with multiple AI agents by providing agent-centric design with unprecedented model support and hackability.

Penpal serves developers and AI enthusiasts who need to create and manage multiple specialized AI agents with full customization control. Unlike chat-oriented AI applications, Penpal puts agent creation first with portable SQLite storage per agent and supports approximately 400 models through BYOK connections to major providers plus local inference options, all built with common web technologies for maximum hackability.
