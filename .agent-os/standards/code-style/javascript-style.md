# JavaScript Style Guide

## Context

For TypeScript projects, see `typescript-style.md`.

This guide is reserved for pure JavaScript standards when needed. Currently, we use TypeScript for all new projects.

## If JavaScript Is Used

- Enable `checkJs` and use JSDoc types for better tooling
- Run ESLint with a compatible parser (`@typescript-eslint/parser`) and JSDoc plugin as needed
- Prefer modern syntax and strict mode; align formatting with Prettier
